// "Injectable" just means we can share it

// way we share it is nothing short of bizarre,
// and we'll see it when we add it to the
// PetListComponent class.
// Don't read more into it! It's just a class
// that contains a list, and a get function
// that returns the list. THAT'S IT.
// ...almost
// One caveat: Angular makes the one instance for us.
// We don't have to make an instance. Angular makes
// one instance and only one, and will hand that
// instance over to any component that needs it.
// In other words: We don't need to make an instance 
// of it. Angular will.
